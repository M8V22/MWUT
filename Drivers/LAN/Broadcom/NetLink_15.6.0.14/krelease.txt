----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ71590 - WHCK: BCM57780 failed on NDISTest GlitchFreeDevice Test.
      Cause:
        The error was introduced with CQ71495 fix, it makes driver doesn't handle RST function correctly.
      Change:
        Make driver not process RST while DPC (for tx completion) is running on a Hyper Threading CPU.
      Note:
        None.


Version 15.6.0.13  Oct 25, 2013
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ71511 - 57786X-K57: System runs into BSOD when Logical CPUs setting to single CPU environment.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ71495 - On OEM system, when streaming real time media from network for some time, the traffic will stop
      Cause:
        When device generates an ISR for tx and rx packet, driver queues two DPCs for them on different CPUs 
        (one on real core and another one on hyper threading core), there is a race condition that makes driver 
        mess up the internal RST parameter/flag, so driver falsely thinks the DPC has not been completed and 
        then it won¡¦t enable the interrupt. So device can¡¦t generate ISR for rx/tx packets anymore.
      Change:
        Make driver doesn't touch RST parameters while it's running DPC for tx packet.
      Impact:
        None.

  1.  Problem:
        CQ60621 - 57762:EEE not functioning properly - Power stays high after traffic removed
      Cause:
        CPMU relies on several hw detection methods to decide whether or not to enter/exit EEE Mode,
        "TXMBUF = 0" is one of it. After some traffic with MMRR enable, it may causes the TXMBUF Count to never go to zero.
        TXMBUF Idle detection logic needs to be updated when the MMRR architecture is added in 57762/57766.  
      Change:
        Workaround: mask this error detection bug by clearing bit 3 of register 0x36B0.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ59003 - Win8 : ping test failure.
      Cause:
        The NDIS function (NdisGroupMaxProcessorCount) doesn't return correct number of processors in 
        a specified processor group. Ex, the system has 2 CPUs and it returns 8. This makes driver 
        doesn't handle interrupt resource assignment correctly, then it causes driver unable to set 
        CPU affinity successfuly for MSI-X interrupt.

      Cause:
        For non-msix devices, the processor number of irq is used for RSS index. 
        If the irq processor number is bigger than RSS rx ring number, the drive 
        will access the invalid RSS rx ring and caused BSOD.
      Change:
        Bypass RSS service if irq processor number is bigger than RSS rx ring number.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  2.  Problem:
        CQ57441 - NXI:WHQL:b57vista failed on NDISTest 6.0 under Vista x86/x64

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ52098 - Certain switches causes connectivity loss during protocol bringup.
      Cause:
        Issue is related to iscsi interaction with vlan tag. Driver was trying to read VLAN setting
        from Nvram for iscsi block, but the device uses OTP. Because of this, wrong VLAN info is used.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ51705 - 57781A0:USB3.0 device will be removed on resuming from S3/S4 if our driver is enabled 
      Cause:
        When driver is doing a GRC Reset, device will lose connection temporarily and run into LAP 
        (Link Aware Power) mode which makes device run at slower clock. This makes bootcode take longer
        time to finish the initilization. While driver is waiting bootcode to deposit the ~KevT signature, 
        it will halt the CPU for waiting and then keep checking the signature from shared memory, the loop 
        may last up to about 500ms, this may cause time-out of other driver.
      Change:
        Change CPMU Clock Policy Registers to increase the Core Clock Speed before issue
        a GRC reset and restore these registers after boot code has completed initialization.

        The receive return produce index in MSI-X status block is incorrect and it makes driver
        to access wrong memory access while indicating received packets to OS then cause system to 
        run into BSOD with bugcheck D1.
      Change:
        Set "Link Idle Power Mode Clock Policy" to 6.25Mhz to make device core clock run faster in 
        Link Idle Power Mode. The original default setting is 3.125 Mhz.
      Impact:
        None

Version 14.4.0.1  Sep 29, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ49169 - 5718: Unable to pass ping traffic after initial driver install.
      Cause:
        OS doesn't handle affinity for MSI-X interrupt properly, device MSI-X interrupt is asserted on the wrong
        CPU and this makes driver doesn't service interupt for Rx RSS correctly. It happens only when driver
        is uninstalled and then installed. It doesn't happen with driver is disabled and then enabled.
      Change:
        Set affinity policy for interrupt in inf file to make OS handle affinity for interrupt correctly.
      Impact:
        None. 

  2.  Problem:
        CQ49979 - Bootcode: PM offload - doesn't respond MAC address when PM-offload enabled with otp.
      Cause:
        The PM Offload firmware is expecting the Tx Mbuf headers to be initialize. 
        This is done by the bootcode but not done by OTP or SB.
      Change:
        Tx Mbuf headers is initialized by PM Offload firmware(v1.12). 
        And driver doesn't need to clean up Tx Mbuf for PM offload.
      Impact:
        None.

----------------------------------------                                        
  1. Problem:
       CQ48805 - 5785 cannot wake from Magic Packet when WOL Speed is set to "Lowest Advertised Speed".	
     Cause:
       GPHY RXC clock is running at incorrect speed (25 MHz instead of 2.5 MHz) 
       when GPHY Inband function is enabled and device is linked at 10Mbps.
     Change:
       Forced RXC to 2.5MHz when WOL speed is linked at "Lowest Advertised Speed" (10Mbps).
     Note:
       This workaround is for 50612E A0 PHY only.
  
  2. Problem:
       CQ48806 - 5785 got the error code 10 when run load/unload device and plug/unplug the cable.   
     Cause:
       50612E A0 PHY enables APD by default after resetting. APD caused PHY locked so that PHY IDs were missed. 
     Change:
       Avoid resetting when running load/unload device.
     Note:
       This workaround is for 50612E A0 PHY only.

      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ46641 - Vista x64 gets BSOD after resuming from S4.
      Cause:
        After resuming from S4, the Receive Return Ring Produce Index read form host memory is incorrect,
        this makes driver access to wrong Rx Buffer Descriptor and touch invalid memory address for buffer data.
      Change:
        Initialize all Receive Return Prod Indexes (of MSI-X status block) to 0 while reseting device.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Add the following changes in driver in order to support customer who uses OTP implementation.
        1) Driver needs to set bit 31 in register PCIE Physical Layer Register 0x1814 to disable clkreq in L2 to 
           workaround a chipset bug.
        2) Driver needs to clear bits [9:7] of PCIE Configuration Space in Function 0 Register 0x6C.  
           This is needed to ensure the SD Host Controller does not lock up.
        3) LAN Driver needs to force the Core Clock to 6.25MHz when the Ethernet Link is in 10Mb mode.  
           This is needed in order to workaround a Hardware synchronization issue in the DMA Read Engine to 
           prevent Fatal Error from stopping the transmitting logic.
      Note: the changes are for 57765/57785 family devices only


Version 14.2.0.2  Apr 02, 2010
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:

  2.  Request:
        CQ46609,CQ45766 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Request:
        CQ46736 - remove fix for CQ39683, CQ40054 from Windows drivers (ndis5, Ndis6)
      Change:
        Make changes as request. These fixes may cause PCIE Serdes corruptions that result in 
        device disappearances when the system resumes from S4 (CQ46606). These fixes are 
        removed from driver and added into OTP selfboot.
      Impact:
        It's for 57780/57760 family devices only.


Version 14.2.0.1  Mar 10, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45486 - 5718: observe a periodical spike when running chariot TX with LSO Disabled
      Cause:
        Driver was unable to switch the interrupt coalescing paramter set (from default to alternate) successfully.
        The alternate set of parameters is intended to make device generate certain numbers of interrupts per second
        under heavy traffic. With unsuccessful switch and driver's dynamic interrupt coalescing enabled, driver stays
        with default parameters set and driver will try to do interrupt coalescing setting switch every 60 seconds 
        when device's interrupt rate is high. This causes throughput to drop a little bit and user will see the 
        periodical spike in chariot graph.
      Change:
        Fine-tune Tx interrupt coalescing parameter (with MSI-X/RSS enabled and LSO disbaled) to make driver switch to 
        and stay with alternate interrupt coalescing parameter set successfully.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Add the missing OEM 4-part IDs in inf file for Win7 x64 OS.
      Change:
        Make change as requested.

  2.  Request:
        Enable Sawtooth bit16, 17, 18 in reg 0x70 for bmapi diag tests.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.2.0.0  Feb 25, 2010
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Restore CQ45685, CQ45686 changes for 14.2 driver release
      Change:
        Make inf change as request.
      Note:  
        CQ45685 - Remove EEE from driver advanced properties for the 14.0 Gold driver
        CQ45686 - Remove driver support for Aspen CR SKU's 57765x, 57785, 57785x, 57795, 57795x

        
Version 14.0.0.7  Feb 12, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45796 - 57781/57765 no link after system resume from S1/S3 mode with SB code.
      Change:
        We have an issue in the SB ROM code which require a 10ms delay after seeing the 
        reset signature (~KevT) in Shared Memory 0xB50 to workaround the issue.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ45467 - 57781: NETBIOS name query/TCP SYN v4 and TCP SYN v6 can't wake up when PM offload enabled.
      Cause:
        PM offload firmware is using shared memory offset 0xd2c (hardware info) to recognize Aspen family devices.
        However, the values are different between 57765 and 57781/57785. This make PM offload can't recognize 57785, 
        so the PM offload firmware code path running with 57781/57785 is incorrect.
      Change:
        Update PM Offload firmware to support 57781/57785.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ44960 - 5785 : PM Offload firmware doesn't generate ARP reply when PM Offloaded is enabled.
      Cause:
        Druing system enting S3 and driver is trying to restart AN for setup PHY to 10M (Wol Speed) 
        while Link is 1G or 100M, this causes MAC and PHY are running at different speeds (MAC: 100M and PHY: 10M) 
        and it causes device is able to receive packet, but unable to transmit packet successfully.
      Change:
        Make driver to restart AN again to make MAC get correct LED status from PHY and run at correct speed.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 14.0.0.6  Feb 05, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45666 - 57765x-system hanged when run Diagnostic test at 100MF/100MH with ASF enabled
      Cause:
        During MAC loopback test in BACS diagnostic testing, there is a racing condition which causes
        driver to free a spin lock which is not acquired yet. The deadlock makes system hang.
      Change:
        Make code change to prevent driver running into the racing condition.
      Impact:
        None.
  2.  Problem:
        CQ45662 - ASPEN(BACS): Diagnostics tests are not suspended for Aspen/57761/57781 adapter .
      Cause:
        The rx standard consumer index from status block is not correct when the driver is suspended.
      Change:
        Force a status block update and stop the hardware to make driver get the most updated index.          
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============

        None.


Version 14.0.0.5  Jan 15, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       When upgrading to the EEE enabled driver. Going from version 14.0.0.4 to version 14.0.04A.
       We could see the EEE property, however both the disable and enable values were missing.
       After a system reboot, we could see them.
     Cause:
       OS can't stick on the default value of EEE property right after driver upgrade.
     Change:
       Add a workaround to force OS to stick with EEE default value after driver upgrade.

  2.  Problem:
        Driver failed on DTM 1c_kernelcalls test

        and have the setting default to disabled.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.4  Jan 08, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ45090 - System gets BSOD (bugcheck 0x7C) while changing speed/duplex to 100M-auto under EEE.
     Cause:
       The timer for EEE function to assert LPI (Low Power Idle) is fired due to the link up/down
       event while driver is going to halt.
     Change:
       Cancel the EEE timer when driver is unloaded.
     Impact:
         None.

  2. Problem:
       CQ45110 - The interrupt/sec counter does not go down noticealby with interrupt moderation enabled.
     Cause:
       Driver is still using default interrupt coalescing settings when interrupt moderation is disabled.
       With interrupt moderation enabled, driver has an implementation for dynamic interrupt coalescing 
       which will switch the interrupt coalescing settings from default to alternate when traffic is busy.
       So under some conditions, driver will stay with default settings with interrupt moderation enabled.
       This makes the interrupt number look the same when interrupt moderations is disabled. 
     Change:
       Disable interrupt coalescing completely when interrupt moderation is disabled.
     Impact:
       None.

  3. Problem:
       CQ45051 - 5718/57765: Running 1 session cc32 is sluggish.
     Change:
       Adjust default interrupt coalescing setting to improve the performance.
     Impact:
       None.

  4. Problem:
       CQ45129 - 57765 : Glitchfreedevice test (in WLK NDISTest6.5) failed on Win2K8R2 x64 with MSI-X enabled
     Cause: 
       Driver doesn't pass RST (Receive Side Throttle) parameter while calling UM_Dpc() from UM_DpcMsi() when MSI-X
       is enabled. This makes driver's function for indicating Rx packets is not aware that RST is enabled and it 
       indicates all packets it has received and causes test failed.
     Change:
       Fix the error to make sure RST paramter is passed to UM_Dpc().
     Impact:
       None.


Version 14.0.0.3  Dec 18, 2009
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44824 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2. Request:
       Enhanced change for EEE function to prevent link drop during heavy traffic.     
     Impact:
       The change is for 57765/57785 and 5717/5718 family devices only.

  3.  Request:
        Add GPHY Green Mode support for 5717/5718/57765/57785 family devices.

        will enable device GPHY Green Mode for saving power.


Version 14.0.0.2  Dec 05, 2009
------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ44702 - The link speed is 100M after system entering S1/S3/S4 mode while Power Management is disabled.
     Cause:
       The bootcode set the link speed at 100M when Vmain goes away is due to the wol enable bit is set in 
       the NVRAM. The bootcode will honor the wol enable bit in nvram is due to no wol_signature in shared 
       memory offset 0xd30.
     Change: 
       Make driver to setup wol signature correctly when wol function is enabled.
     Impact:
       None

  2. Problem:
       CQ42316 - During Factory X64 download, Active directory scripts are not downloading.
     Cause:
       The Netlongon service starts before network is ready. The reason why netowrk is not ready is due to 
       an additional GPHY reset added during code merge for 5785, this extra GPHY reset makes device take 
       longer time to link up while driver is loaded. 
     Change: 
       Make the GPHY reset for 5785 only, not for other devices.
     Impact:
       None

  Enhancements:
  =============

        CQ44113 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        Due to a GPHY setting change, driver needs to add a patch for 5785 GPHY devices.
      Change:
        After global reset or GPHY reset, driver will set 50610 (M or non-M) RGMII MODE to 0.
      Impact:
        It's for 5785 with 50610(M or non-M) GPHY revision.


Version 12.4.0.2 Oct 11, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        57760/57780 fails on FwCfg 1G loopback test.
      Cause:
        The GPHY Green Mode is enabled when device is linked at 1G speed and it causes
        FwCfg unable to receiving packets during loopback test.
      Change:
        Make driver not to enable GPHY Green Mode while making external loopback test.
      Note:
        None

   2.  Problem:
        CQ43851- Device disappears after multiple iterations of copy/compare test on specific OEM system.
      Cause:
        Due to design limitations, sometimes L1 exit transition does not cause the serdes pll to resume
        normal operation.  When this happens the LOM will not be able to response to PCIE transaction 
        and may be removed from the PCIE enumeration tree.
      Change:
        Implement the workaround to disable Pll Powerdown in L1 by writting 0x7080 to register offset 
        0x7d54 afer every chip reset. 
      Note:
        It's for 57760/57780 family devices only.
        
  Enhancements:

      Impact:
        None.


Version 12.4.0.1  Sep 28, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ43465 : Under network stress test in Windows 2008R2, the LOM will disconnect within 10 minutes.
      Cause:
        During ISR, NDIS 6.20 driver calls the NdisMQueueDpcEx function to schedule DPC calls on CPUs.
        Under rare condition (ex. the CPU serives the interrupt is very busy) and it causes the DPC 
        (scheduled for another CPU) start to run immediately before the ISR finished, this messes driver's 
        count for pending DPC and it causes the interrupt is not enabled anymore.
      Change:
        Move the code (calls to NdisMQueueDpcEx) to end of ISR to resolve the race condition.
      Note:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ43619 - Update Product_Version String to 14.2.0 for Release 12.4.

        Apply two new power saving enhancements for BCM5785: 
      Change:
        1. disable Rx/Tx clock to save more power when APD is on for BCM5785.
        2. Force to MII interface when the link is down to save more power.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 12.4.0.0  Sep 10, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ43026 - b57vista: RSS function doesn't work when enabled.
      Cause:
        The structures NDIS_RECEIVE_SCALE_PARAMETERS (specifies the RSS parameters) are different between 
        NDIS 6.20 and earilier then NDIS 6.20. The formats of indirection table are different as well.
        These make driver doesn't handle OID_GEN_RECEIVE_SCALE_PARAMETERS properly and the device RSS
        function is not configured correctly.
      Change:
        Modify driver code to handle the new structure correctly while compling with Win7 DDK.
      Note:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ43147, CQ43374 - Add 4 part IDs for specific OEM
      Change:
        Added new IDs

----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       Win7 fails GlitchFreeDevice in Ndistest 6.5.
     Cause:
       The fix for CQ42470 introduced a code error that makes RST doesn't work properly.
     Change:
       Fix the code error.
     Impact:
       None.  


Version 12.2.2.1  Aug 04, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ42561 - Changing speed to 10mbps results in black screen under Windows on 5785.
     Change:
       Set 10MB Speed Policy to 12.5MHz.
     Impact:
       None.  

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        Use standardized INF keywords for PM Offload descriptions.
      Change:
        Make inf changes to use "ARP offload" and "NS offload" accordingly.

        Added new IDs


Version 12.2.0.7  Jul 27, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ42593 - Mazama(5785) Ethernet@Wirespeed Feature does not work.
      Cause:
        GPHY Ethernet@Wirespeed function is disabled by driver.
      Change:
        Enable the function for 5785.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ42470 - System gets blue screen (with bugcheck D1) during sleep stress tests.
      Cause:
        When driver is processing RST in DPC and the value returned from NDIS marco "NDIS_CURRENT_PROCESSOR_NUMBER"
        is larger than RSS rings number, this causes driver to unexpectedly assign NULL value to another member
        (called pRxJumboBdVirt) in driver's low device block structure. Then system gets BSOD when driver is running
         the code with pRxJumboBdVirt when system is resuming from Standby.
      Change:
        Ensure RstParam in driver's low device block is never accessed with a subscript that is too large.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ42667 - PM Offload doesn't work when it's enabled.
      Cause:
        IPv6 Neighbor Advertisement packet is broken with uninitialized TX Mbuf header field.
      Change:
        Make driver to zero out TxMBuf from 0x9E80-0x9FFF for PM Offload Firmware.
      Impact:
        None.

        Postpone 10Mbps to 1Gbps transition when the LCD ON event occurs in a middle of busy traffic.
      Change:
        Make driver change as request.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ42236 workaround - Driver needs to implement the following procedures before any GRC or CPU reset
        1. write 0x7d54 with 0x7080 (to disable l1 pll pwrdwn), then
        2. do a dummy read of 0x7d54 to flush the write, then
        3. issue GRC or CPU reset.
      Change:
        Make driver change as requested.
      Impact:
        It's for 57760/57780/57790 family devices only.

  3.  Request:
        To address the DMA writes broken up into small chunks.
      Change:
        Set the bit 31 and 30 of Write DMA Control Register.
      Impact:
        It's only for 5785 family devices.


Version 12.2.0.6  Jul 13, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ42247 - 5761(LOM) : PM offload dies after few iterations
      Cause:
        PM Offload firmware was locking/unlocking thw SW arbitration bit during initialization 
        to access the NVRAM. Apparently there was some timing issue with the driver on OEM system 
        during the downloading of the firrmware causing the SW arbitration bit to stay lock thus
        causing the firmware not to run.
      Change:
        Resolution is to remove access to NVRAM since firmware does not need any info from NVRAM.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ42324 - 57780A1:LOM disappear after resuming from S4, only happend withSelfboot/OTP boot 
        and LED mode = shared traffic/link LED mode
      Cause:
        Driver is trying to write Ethernet PHY with incorrect PHY address (should be 1 instead of 0) 
        during initializatin. This causes driver to write to PCI-E Serdes PHY by accident and 
        corrupt PCI-E Serdes PHY content.
      Change:
        Make sure PhyAddr is assigned with valid value before accessing Ethernet PHY.
      Impact:
        None.
 
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ42432, CQ42543 - Add 4 part IDs for specific OEM
      Change:
        Added new IDs


Version 12.2.0.5  Jul 07, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ42109 - Win7: 57780 can not do arp respone for a long time with PM offload enable.
      Cause:
        The RxMBuf memory size allocated for the CiLai PM Offload firmware to store its data 
        was too small. The firmware data was overflowing into the RxMBuf area used for received
        packets thus causing a corruption of the firrmware data.
      Change:
        Increased RxMbuf memory used by the CiLai PM Offload firmware to store its data. 
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ39683: Cilai detects Receiver Error when the Link Transition between L0s/L0
      Change:
        workaround: shorten the delay of the electrical idle signal from serdes
        a. write register 0x7e70 bit [4:0] with 0x0c during device initialization or device reset
        b. write all ones to register 0x110 (correctable error status). 

  2.  Request:
        CQ40054: PLL power down common mode voltage glitch on Tx
      Change:        
        workaround: use low-power transmitter mode during device initialization or device reset 
        changed PCIe SerDes register values to the following 
        a. Register 0x15 in block 0x8610 = 0x47b.
        b. Register 0x1A in block 0x8010 = 0x4038.

        Add Windows 7 Power Management Offload support for 57760/577805/7790
      Change:
        Support for this new feature is added in this driver version.
      Impact:
        The PM Offload firmware is now bound to the driver, so any update
        will require a driver spin moving forward. Also, PM Offload is not 
        compatible with ASF, so will be disabled if ASF is enabled.

  5.  Request:
        CQ42092 - Add 57788 support (VID: 14e4, DID: 1691)
      Change:

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ41216 - Win7-NetBIOS name query cannot wake up system
      Cause:
        Driver doesn't set "end of wol comparison stream" correctly when pattern size is an odd numer.
      Change:
        Make driver to handle pattern size (odd number) correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
       CQ41352 - BCM5754M fails WOL on ICMP PING test
      Cause:
       When pattern size is less than 64 bytes and byte mask is less than 8 byte, driver will try to
       set "end of wol comparison pattern" at 64 bytes (the minimun ethernet packets) but it never happens.
       Without setting "end of wol comparison stream", device is unable to detect wol packet correctly.
      Change:
       Make driver to set "end of wol comparison pattern" correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ40826 - (LCD trigger link speed change feature) device should change the link speed to 10Mbps after traffic is no longer busy

      Change:
        Add the standardized registry key "*IPChecksumOffloadIPv4" in INF files as requested.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ41003 - System gets BSOD on NDISTest 6.0 - 1c_registry test
      Cause:
        During 1c_registry test, the registry key "RSSRxRing" is set with invalid value
        and this makes driver's RSS code can't work properly.
      Change:
        Adding boundary check to protect driver from using invalid registry key values.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:

      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Request:
        Initial RSS V2 support.


Version 12.2.0.1  May 04, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ40782 - NDISTest6.5 (WoL and PM) failed on WolWin7Pattern test under Window 7.
      Cause:
        Driver is setting END of WOL stream according to (Mask Size * 8), instead of Pattern Length.
        When the wol pattern length is less than (Mask Size *8), device is unable to recognize
        the packet as a valid packet and it won't wake up system.
      Change
        Make driver to set END of WOL stream according to WOL pattern length.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:

Version 11.27.00.00  Dec 17, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ36053 - Windiag shows "Device failed to negotiate link after 15sec" during PHY reset test
      Cause:
        Some device may generate "Link Status Change" interrupt immediately after powering down GPHY.
        This causes driver to run LM_SetupPhy() in UM_DPC() for servicing GPHY interrupt, while the
        application may send another T3_OID_PHY_ON to driver for powering on GPHY. This causes two
        driver threads to access GPHY at the same time, and it may cause GPHY content programmed
        with incorrect value.
      Change:
        Disable interrupt before powering down GPHY.
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ38997 - 57780 MAC loopback will fail without connection.
      Cause:
        When ethernet cable is dettached & GPHY auto-power-down w/pll power down is enabled, GPHY
        pll would power down to save power (link aware apd mode) and stop providing clock to MAC.
        When mac loopback mode is enabled under this condition mac cannot switch to fast clock to
        complete packet transfers and therefore causes packet to drop.
      Change:
        The workaround is to disable GPHY PLL APD during MAC loopback test.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ38982 - NDISTest 6.0: 5785 failed on 1c_mini6rssoids under Vista x86.
      Cause:
        Driver doesn't advertise RSS support for the device.
      Change
        Add code changes for driver to enable 5785 RSS function.
      Impact:
        None.

      Impact:
        None


Version 11.22.0.0  Sep 03, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ37154 - OEM 5784M platform observes the same S5 WOL issue as CQ35234
      Cause:
        CQ35234 GPHY workaround was applied when system is going into S1/S3/S4, not for S5.
      Change:

      Cause: The Tx code path runs out of credit on some of the processors, so aborts without
        sending anything. This is occuring because a software timer
        failed to schedule the DPC responsible for calculating this credit. The DPCs were not
        scheduled for more than 4 procs on x86 systems, and 8 procs on x64 systems.
        This driver version fixes this problem
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ36843 - Add registry key to common mini-port driver in order to allow NDIS to discard VLAN tagged packets
      Changes:

        CQ35947 - B5764/B5761/B5784-When setting  WOL speed to 10mb system will be come unresponsive and lose link.
      Cause:
        The CQ35234 workaround is incorrectly executed when driver is loaded with WOL speed setting as 10mb.
        There is no problem when WOL speed is set to Lowest, Auto or 100mb.
      Change:
        Correct driver's abnormal behavior and make driver to apply the CQ35234 workaround precisely.
      Impact:
        None.

      Cause:
      Change:
        Changed the inbox inf as requested.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        35447 - Windows 7 Inbox:  Please Make INF Header consistent with NXII Driver INF.
      Cause:
      Change:
        Changed the inbox inf as requested.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 11.20.0.0  June 9, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ35239 - 5784m stops passing traffic when running copy compare at 10 Mb half duplex and ASPM L1 w/ clkreq.
      Cause:
        The clock glitch that occurring with L0->L1->L0 transitions causes device RDMA doesn't work normally.
      Change:
        Make driver to disable device's clkreq when linked at 10H or 100H as a workaround.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ35239.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ35234 - 5784M/5764M will not assert Wake signal one the first Wake magic packet received.
      Cause:
        When device is connected to particular switch with specific PHY at 1G bps, with wol speed
        set to lowest speed, driver will program GPHY to advertise 10M bps support and restart
        auto-negotiation while system is going from S0 to S3/S4/S5. In the meantime, 100tx or 1000t
        idle sent from the link partner can confuse the local 10M bps polarity state machine, which
        in turn can corrupt the first 10Mbps packet received.
      Change:
        Make driver workaround to reset link porlarity state machine and restart auto negotiation.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ35234.

  Enhancements:
  =============

      Change:
        Changed the BRCM naming convention to match the one MSFT mandates.


Version 11.19.0.0  May 12, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ34962 - 5784/5764/5761 system compatibility issue on particular OEM system.
      Cause:
        When BIOS sets root-complex's and device's Max Payload Size (MPS) to 256 bytes,
        device's MPS will be incorrectly set to 128 by driver, then device will report
        ERROR_FATAL and stop DMA when it makes Memory Read and receives completion
        packets larger than 128 bytes.
      Change:
        Make driver to keep device MPS setting during initialization.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ34962.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ34822 - Network traffic drops after SUT wakes up from S3/S4 while WOL is disabled.
      Cause:
        The reason why device doesn't pass traffic after system resuming from S3 (with
        "Allow computer to turn off xxx" is unchecked) is because the upper layer doesn't use
        the OID_OFFLOAD_ENCAPSULATION OID to set the task offload encapsulation settings
        of an underlying miniport, and this makes our driver fails to send certain packets
        which need driver/device to take care of checksum offload tasks.
      Change:

Version 11.12.0.0  February 24, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ33858 - Device loses connection while doing load/unload test.
      Cause:
        When driver is unloaded, driver does a GRC Reset. When the link doesn't come back
        immediately, CPMU will put MAC core clock into slower speed. This makes boot code
        to be reloaed and executed slower. This also makes driver exceed waiting loop.
        Finally, GPHY register corrupted because of driver and boot-code racing condition.
      Change:
        Extend driver waiting time to make sure boot-code 2nd phase is finished.

      Cause:
        New chip requiring different actions.
      Change:
        Activate hardware fix for this CQ in driver and not with code in
        the receive packet processing logic.
      Impact:
        New devices have hardware support for this fix that must be
        activated in the driver.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
          CQ33808 - BCM5784M: System hangs when user changes Device Property with clkreq enabled.
      Cause:
          Issuing a GRC reset with clkreq enabled is causing a global chip reset and PCI-E
          completion timer timeout.
      Change:
          When ClkReq and L0s/L1 ASPM are enabled, driver will clear ClkReq enable bit before doing
          GRC reset and restore it after GRC reset.
      Impact:

      Cause:
        System hung while driver was trying to acquire a spin lock in UM_CheckForHang(). Driver was
        making two continuous main lock acquisitions. The first one came from UM_QueryInformation(),
        when BACS passed T3_OID_DIAG_SUSPEND to driver during the test. The second one came from
        UM_CheckForHang(), which was called by NDIS every two seconds.
      Change:
        Make driver doesn't acquire main lock in UM_CheckForHang while cable analysis is still running.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ32886 issue.

  4.  Problem:

      Cause:
        The WMI method that ndistest is using does NOT return any class derived from Win32_PerfRawData class.
        It only returns "normal" WMI classes. However, the WMI class we provided is derived from Win32_PerfRawData
        class and it's used for graphing driver data to perfmon.exe along with some OS¡¦s provided perf data.
      Change:
        Create a registry key to control driver for enabling/disabling WMI perf counts.
      Impact:

      Cause:
        Device has a problem with logic that handles the automatic switching of the burst mode
        to non-burst mode when the core clock is switching from 62.5MHz to slow clock modes.
      Change:
        Disable WDMA Rx Accel mode to workaround this issue.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ32573 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ32692 - BSOD in Vista with driver while running common scenario stress
      Cause:
        Driver incorrectly cleans 5784M RX return ring producer index during system suspend/resume
        from sleep. This makes driver get stuck when OS is trying put system into sleep again.
        While OS is telling driver to put device into D3, driver can't complete IRP (IRP_MJ_POWER
        /IRP_MN_SET_POWER) and this causes system BSOD with Bug check - DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE.
      Change:
        Make driver to behave correctly - not clean 5784M RX return ring producer index during

      Change:
        Configure LED Mode default to MAC Mode for 5784M A0 & A1.


Version 11.2.0.0  October 24, 2007
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ31830 - System hangs when put it into S3 and S4 or disable the adapter with WOL disabled.
      Cause:
        When WOL is not needed, driver will power down GPHY for saving power. When GPHY powers down,
        GPHY DLL stops provinding clock to mac core and this causes memory read completion timeout.
      Change:
        Make mac core clock switching before powering down GPHY.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ31830 issue.

  Enhancements:
