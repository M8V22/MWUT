The M4CXVISTA.sys driver allows you to modify several options in order to
optimize the operation of your adapter.

1.  In "Network Connections" right click on the adapter you 
    want to configure.
2.  Select "Properties". 
3.  Click "Configure".
4.  Click "Advanced".
5.  In the "Property" box, select the option that you want to change.
6.  Enter the desired value in the "Value" box.
7.  When finished, click OK .
The operating system will reload the driver with the changed settings.

The parameters supported by the driver are described below.



Network Address
------------------------
Default value:  burned-in adapter address
Valid range:    02-00-00-00-00-01 to FE-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF (hexadecimal), 
                where at least the "multicast" bit(Bit 0) must not be set 
                (it indicates that the address field contains an 
                individual address)and the "locally administered" bit (Bit 1) 
                is set (the address has been assigned by a local
                administrator). These two bits are first and second 
                bits transmitted on the LAN medium.

CAUTION: Each individual network MAC address can only be used once in a
         network. Assigning the same address to more than one adapter in 
         the same network is not allowed and can cause serious network 
         problems.

To use a network MAC address other than the one burned into the adapter,
enter the network address in the following hexadecimal format:

	e.g.: 02-00-5A-98-12-34

If the network address field blank is left blank (or a different number of
digits is specified), the network address burned into the adapter will 
be used.


Jumbo Frame Support
------------------------
Default value: "Disabled"
Valid values:   
	-"Disabled"
	-"4088"
	-"9014"

This parameter specifies the frame size that the driver will support. 
The performance of your network usually increases If "Jumbo" frames are 
used. Do not enable this option if you are not sure that your network 
supports jumbo frames.

Note: For Fast Ethernet adapters the valid range is limited to 1514.

Hardware Checksuming
------------------------
Default value: "On"
Valid values:
	-"On"
 	-"Off"

This parameter is used to disable the hardware checksum offload for 
TCP/IP. There should be no need to disable checksum offload.


Wake Up Capabilities
------------------------
Default value: "Magic Packet and Pattern Magic"
Valid values:
	-"None"
		wake on LAN capabilities are disabled
	-"Magic Packet"
		wake up with MagicPacket from ShutDown state,
		OS Controlled from Hibernate or Standby state
	-"Pattern Match"
		wake up with a packet containing a special pattern
		from ShutDown state, OS Controlled from Hibernate 
		or Standby state
	-"Magic Packet and Pattern Match"
		wake up with both from ShutDown state, OS Controlled
		from Hibernate or Standby state
	-"Link Change"
		wake up with link change from ShutDown state,
		OS Controlled from Hibernate or Standby state

                        
Wake From Shutdown
------------------------
Default value: "Off"
Valid values:
	-"Off"
		disable the capabilities of the NIC to wake the computer 
		from shutdown.
	-"On"
		enable the NIC to be capable to wake the computer from shutdown.


Number of Receive Buffers
------------------------
For Yukon family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  50 (decimal)
Valid range:    3..500 (decimal)

For Yukon2 family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  256 (decimal)
Valid range:    256..512 (decimal)

This parameters defines the number of receive buffers allocated by the
driver. If the system does not have enough resources the driver will fail 
to load. Increasing this value may improve performance.


Number of Transmit Buffers
------------------------
For Yukon family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  50 (decimal)
Valid range:    4..200 (decimal)

For Yukon2 family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  256 (decimal)
Valid range:    256..512 (decimal)

This parameters defines the number of transmit buffers allocated by the
driver. If the system does not have enough resources the driver will 
fail to load. Increasing this value may improve performance.


Interrupt Moderation
------------------------
Default value: "On"
Valid values:
	-"On"
	-"Off"

If more than the specified rate of interrupts occur, the function 
Interrupt Moderation groups these interrupts so that several data packets 
can be handled per interrupt. This will lead to lower CPU utilization 
but may increase the latency.


Max IRQ per Sec
------------------------
Default value:  5000 (decimal)
Valid range:    1000..30000 (decimal)

This parameter specifies the interrupt rate for Interrupt Moderation. If
Interrupt Moderation is set to "Off" it will be ignored.

Log Status Messages
------------------------
Default value: "Status Messages"
Valid values:
	-"All Messages":
		This option should only be used for test purposes.
	-"Status Messages":
		In this mode the driver will generate an event log 
		entry every time the link status changes.
	-"Warnings":
		In this mode you will only receive warning or error 
		messages.
	-"Errors":
		In this mode you will only receive error messages.
	-"None":
		All driver messages will be suppressed. It is not 
		recommended to use this value.

This parameter specifies the messages, which are to be logged in the 
Event Log.

Speed & Duplex
------------------------
Default value: "Auto-Sense"
Valid range:
	-"Auto-Sense"
	-"10Mbps Half Duplex"
	-"10Mbps Full Duplex"
	-"100Mbps Half Duplex"
	-"100Mbps Full Duplex"

This parameter contain information regarding autonegotiation, 
duplex capabilities and link speed. Only if the setting is "Auto" the 
Autonegotiation is set to "On", in every other settings it is turned "Off".

NOTE: This parameter is not valid for fiber adapter.


Preferred Port
------------------------
Default value: "A"
Valid range:
	-"A"
	-"B"

NOTE: This parameter is only available for dual link adapters.

Use this parameter to set the preferred port the RLMT (Redundant
Link Management Technology) will use for all network traffic, if more than
one port has an active link to the network.


RLMT Mode
------------------------
Default value: "CLS"
Valid range:
	-"CLS" (Check Link State): 
		RLMT uses the link state reported by the
 		adapter hardware for each individual port to determine whether a 
 		port can be used for all network traffic or not.

	-"CLP" (Check Local Port):
		In this mode, RLMT monitors the network path
 		between the two ports of an adapter by regularly exchanging packets 
		between them. This mode requires a network configuration in which 
		the two ports "see" each other (i.e. there must not be any router 
		between the ports).

	-"CLPSS" (Check Local Ports and Segmentation Status):
		This mode supports 
		the same functions as the CLP mode and additionally checks network 
		segmentation by sending BPDU hello packets. Thus, this mode is only 
		to be used if Gigabit Ethernet switches are installed on the network
		that have been configured to use the Spanning Tree protocol.

NOTE: RLMT modes "CLP" and "CLPSS" are designed to operate in 
      configurations where a network path between the ports on one adapter
      exists. Moreover, they are not designed to work where adapters are
      connected back-to-back.
      This parameter is only available for dual link adapters.


802.1p Support
------------------------
Default Value:	"Off"
Valid Values:
	-"Off"
	-"On"

This parameter will enable/disable the quality of service for specified
port. By default this option is not enabled at the first install of 
the driver.




BatteryModeLinkDetection
------------------------
Default Value: "EnergyDetect+(TM)"
Valid Values:
	-"NoEnergySaving":
		No Energy saving functions are switched on in the NIC. 

	-"MaximumEnergySaving":
		The NIC is switched off if there is no link in battery mode. 
		The driver wakes up the NIC every 20 seconds to check 
		if there is a new link.

	-"EnergyDetect+(TM)":
		If battery-powered the NIC is set to "EnergyDetect+"(TM) mode. 
		The link is activated faster than in "MaximumEnergySaving" mode, 
		but the NIC requires more power.

This parameter will set the mode in which the NIC is working if there 
is no link and the PC is battery-powered.




BatterySpeedSettings
------------------------
Default Value: "FullSpeed"
Valid Values:	
	-"SmartSpeedDown":
		If the computer is battery-powered, the NIC speed is 
		switched to 10/100Mbit/s to reduce the power consumption.

	- "FullSpeed":
		If the computer is battery-powered the NIC is working with 
		maximum speed and maximum power consumption.
		If the computer is supplied by AC power all power saving features 
		are switched off, and the NIC is working with maximum speed.

This parameter will sets the Line speed for the NIC if PC is 
battery-powered.



FlowControl
------------------------
Default value: "On"
Valid range:
	-"Off":
		No link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames.

	-"On":
		Both link partners are allowed to send PAUSE frames.
		
This parameter can be used to set the flow control capabilities the port
reports during auto-negotiation. This parameter can be set for each port
individually, which is helpful if the port at the other end of the cable cannot
handle all possible combinations. Using the default setting, the adapter should
automatically detect the capabilities of the peer port.

   
TCP Segmentation
------------------------
Default value: "Enabled"
Valid range:
	-"Enabled":
		The big packets are segmented on the NIC before to be sent to the 
 		network. Using this method the processor will be not loaded to do 
		this job.

	-"Disabled":
		The packets are not segmented by the NIC.

NOTE: 	This parameter is only available starting with the NICs based on 
		Yukon2 chip.
