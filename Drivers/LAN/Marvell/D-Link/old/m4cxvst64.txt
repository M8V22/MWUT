1  Overview
===========

M4CXVST64.sys is the NDIS6.0 64-bit Miniport driver.


***


2  Required Files
=================

To install the driver, the following files are required:
M4CXVST64.sys NDIS6.0 Miniport driver
M4CXVST64.inf installation setup script
M4CXVST64.CAT digital signature (only if the driver is certified)
***

3  Installation
===============

3.1  Installing the driver
--------------------------

Read the installation instructions in the adapter manual carefully.
Follow these instructions to install the adapter in your computer.


Due to the plug & play facility, the operating system is able to find,
identify, and configure an adapter automatically.

If the adapter is not detected during installation by the operating system the
adapter is installed as "Ethernet Controller" under "Other Devices".
To install the driver you have to perform a driver update as described 
in the next section.

***


3.2  Updating the driver
------------------------


To update the driver, proceed as follows:

1.  On the desktop right click on MY COMPUTER.
2.  Select MANAGE.
3.  In the "Device Manager" select the adapter you wish to update.
4.  Double click. 
5.  Select DRIVER.
6.  Click UPDATE DRIVER ... .
7. Follow the instructions given by the operating system to locate the driver.
8.  If the driver which is found to be the latest is not the one you want 
    to install, select the checkbox "Install one of the other drivers".
9.  Click NEXT. 
10. Select the driver to be installed in the next listbox.
11. Click NEXT.
    If a message is displayed saying that the driver is not digitally signed 
    by Microsoft, click YES.
12. The message "Windows has finished installing the software for this 
    device" is displayed.
13. Click FINISH to complete the installation.


Please note that the latest version of the M4CXVST64 driver is
available for download from our web site.


4  Parameters
=============

The M4CXVST64.sys driver allows you to modify several options in order to
optimize the operation of your adapter.

1.  In "Network Connections" right click on the adapter you 
    want to configure.
2.  Select "Properties". 
3.  Click "Configure".
4.  Click "Advanced".
5.  In the "Property" box, select the option that you want to change.
6.  Enter the desired value in the "Value" box.
7.  When finished, click OK .
The operating system will reload the driver with the changed settings.

The parameters supported by the driver are described below.



Network Address
------------------------
Default value:  burned-in adapter address
Valid range:    02-00-00-00-00-01 to FE-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF (hexadecimal), 
                where at least the "multicast" bit(Bit 0) must not be set 
                (it indicates that the address field contains an 
                individual address)and the "locally administered" bit (Bit 1) 
                is set (the address has been assigned by a local
                administrator). These two bits are first and second 
                bits transmitted on the LAN medium.

CAUTION: Each individual network MAC address can only be used once in a
         network. Assigning the same address to more than one adapter in 
         the same network is not allowed and can cause serious network 
         problems.

To use a network MAC address other than the one burned into the adapter,
enter the network address in the following hexadecimal format:

	e.g.: 02-00-5A-98-12-34

If the network address field blank is left blank (or a different number of
digits is specified), the network address burned into the adapter will 
be used.


Jumbo Frame Support
------------------------
Default value: "Disabled"
Valid values:   
	-"Disabled"
	-"4088"
	-"9014"

This parameter specifies the frame size that the driver will support. 
The performance of your network usually increases If "Jumbo" frames are 
used. Do not enable this option if you are not sure that your network 
supports jumbo frames.

Note: For Fast Ethernet adapters the valid range is limited to 1514.

Hardware Checksuming
------------------------
Default value: "On"
Valid values:
	-"On"
 	-"Off"

This parameter is used to disable the hardware checksum offload for 
TCP/IP. There should be no need to disable checksum offload.


Number of Receive Buffers
------------------------
For Yukon family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  50 (decimal)
Valid range:    3..500 (decimal)

For Yukon2 family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  256 (decimal)
Valid range:    256..512 (decimal)

This parameters defines the number of receive buffers allocated by the
driver. If the system does not have enough resources the driver will fail 
to load. Increasing this value may improve performance.


Number of Transmit Buffers
------------------------
For Yukon family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  50 (decimal)
Valid range:    4..200 (decimal)

For Yukon2 family based ethernet controllers the following values are used:
Default value:  256 (decimal)
Valid range:    256..512 (decimal)

This parameters defines the number of transmit buffers allocated by the
driver. If the system does not have enough resources the driver will 
fail to load. Increasing this value may improve performance.


Interrupt Moderation
------------------------
Default value: "On"
Valid values:
	-"On"
	-"Off"

If more than the specified rate of interrupts occur, the function 
Interrupt Moderation groups these interrupts so that several data packets 
can be handled per interrupt. This will lead to lower CPU utilization 
but may increase the latency.


Max IRQ per Sec
------------------------
Default value:  5000 (decimal)
Valid range:    1000..30000 (decimal)

This parameter specifies the interrupt rate for Interrupt Moderation. If
Interrupt Moderation is set to "Off" it will be ignored.

Log Status Messages
------------------------
Default value: "Status Messages"
Valid values:
	-"All Messages":
		This option should only be used for test purposes.
	-"Status Messages":
		In this mode the driver will generate an event log 
		entry every time the link status changes.
	-"Warnings":
		In this mode you will only receive warning or error 
		messages.
	-"Errors":
		In this mode you will only receive error messages.
	-"None":
		All driver messages will be suppressed. It is not 
		recommended to use this value.

This parameter specifies the messages, which are to be logged in the 
Event Log.


802.1p Support
------------------------
Default Value:	"Off"
Valid Values:
	-"Off"
	-"On"

This parameter will enable/disable the quality of service for specified
port. By default this option is not enabled at the first install of 
the driver.

FlowControl
------------------------
Default value: "On"
Valid range:
	-"Off":
		No link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames.

	-"On":
		Both link partners are allowed to send PAUSE frames.
		
This parameter can be used to set the flow control capabilities the port
reports during auto-negotiation. This parameter can be set for each port
individually, which is helpful if the port at the other end of the cable cannot
handle all possible combinations. Using the default setting, the adapter should
automatically detect the capabilities of the peer port.

   
TCP Segmentation
------------------------
Default value: "Enabled"
Valid range:
	-"Enabled":
		The big packets are segmented on the NIC before to be sent to the 
 		network. Using this method the processor will be not loaded to do 
		this job.

	-"Disabled":
		The packets are not segmented by the NIC.

NOTE: 	This parameter is only available starting with the NICs based on 
		Yukon2 chip.
